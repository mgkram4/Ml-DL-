# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Learning with labeled examples to make predictions on new data.

**Key Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression: `y = wx + b`
- Logistic Regression: `p = 1/(1 + e^(-z))`
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

**Applications:**
- Email spam detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock price prediction
- Image classification

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

**Key Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- DBSCAN

**Applications:**
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Data compression
- Market basket analysis

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Learning through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.

**Key Concepts:**
- Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward
- Q-Learning: `Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]`
- Policy Gradient Methods

**Applications:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Robotics
- Trading algorithms

## Core Concepts

### Loss Functions
Measure how well our model performs:

- **Mean Squared Error (Regression)**: `MSE = (1/n)Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)²`
- **Cross-Entropy (Classification)**: `CE = -Σy_i log(ŷ_i)`
- **Hinge Loss (SVM)**: `L = max(0, 1 - y_i(w·x_i + b))`

### Optimization
Finding the best parameters for our model:

- **Gradient Descent**: `θ = θ - α∇J(θ)`
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Adam Optimizer**
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**

### Model Evaluation
Assessing how well our model generalizes:

- **Train/Validation/Test Split**
- **Cross-Validation**
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC

### Overfitting and Regularization
Preventing models from memorizing training data:

- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: `λΣ|w_i|`
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: `λΣw_i²`
- **Dropout**
- **Early Stopping**
